Neuroimaging analysis of Forrest Gump fMRI watching, with analysis of musical features of the soundtrack

This is the code repository for a Neuroimaging Master's project done in 2021 by Leonardo Muller-Rodriguez, under supervision of Owen O'Daly.
Here, only Leonardo's code is made public. This mainly involves extraction and analysis of acoustic/musical features.

Feedback on the code would be appreciated
